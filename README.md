# Elasticsearch PHP client

[![Build status](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/workflows/PHP%20test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/actions) [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/elasticsearch/elasticsearch) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/elasticsearch/elasticsearch)

This is the official PHP client for
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/).

You can run [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) on your local machine using this command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```
or **[sign-up](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?elektra=en-ess-sign-up-page)**
**for a free trial of Elastic Cloud**.

## Installation

Refer to the [Installation section](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_installation)
of the getting started documentation.

## Connecting

Refer to the [Connecting section](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_connecting)
of the getting started documentation.

## Usage

The `elasticsearch-php` client offers 500+ endpoints for interacting with
Elasticsearch. A list of all these endpoints is available in the
[official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html)
of Elasticsearch APIs.

Here we reported the basic operation that you can perform with the client:
index, search and delete.

- [Creating an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_creating_an_index)
- [Indexing a document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_indexing_documents)
- [Getting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_getting_documents)
- [Searching documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_searching_documents)
- [Updating documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_updating_documents)
- [Deleting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_deleting_documents)
- [Deleting an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_deleting_an_index)

### Versioning

This client is versioned and released alongside Elasticsearch server.

To guarantee compatibility, use the most recent version of this library within
the major version of the corresponding Enterprise Search implementation.

For example, for Elasticsearch `8.16`, use `8.16` of this library or above, but
not `9.0`.

## Compatibility

The Elasticsearch client is compatible with currently maintained PHP versions.

Language clients are forward compatible; meaning that clients support
communicating with greater or equal minor versions of Elasticsearch without
breaking. It does not mean that the client automatically supports new features
of newer Elasticsearch versions; it is only possible after a release of a new
client version. For example, a 8.12 client version won't automatically support
the new features of the 8.13 version of Elasticsearch, the 8.13 client version
is required for that. Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards
compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.

| Elasticsearch Version | Elasticsearch-PHP Branch | Supported |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| main                  | main                     |           |
| 9.x                   | 9.x                      | 9.x       |
| 8.x                   | 8.x                      | 8.x       |

## Backward Incompatible Changes :boom:

The 9.0.0 version of `elasticsearch-php` contains the same architecture of 8.x.
It supports [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) for HTTP messages and
[PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) for HTTP client communications.

We tried to avoid BC breaks for `9.x`, here the main changes:

- **Compatibility with Elasticsearch 9.0:** All changes and additions to Elasticsearch APIs for its 9.0 release are reflected in this release.
- **Serverless client merged in:** the `elastic/elasticsearch-serverless` client is being deprecated, and its functionality has been merged back into this client. This should have zero impact on the way the client works by default. If an endpoint is available in serverless, the PHP function will contains a `@group serverless` phpdoc attribute.
If you try to use an endpoint that is not available in serverless you will get a `410` HTTP error with a message as follows:
"this endpoint exists but is not available when running in serverless mode".
The 9.0.0 client can recognize that it is communicating with a serverless instance if you are using a URL managed by Elastic (e.g. `*.elastic.cloud`).
If you are using a proxy, the client will be able to recognize that the host is serverless from the first response. Alternatively, you can explicitly indicate that the host is serverless using the `Client::setServerless(true)` function (`false` by default).
- **New transport library with PSR-18 cURL client as default:** we've removed the Guzzle dependency from the client. By default, the built-in cURL-based HTTP client will be used if no other PSR-18 compatible clients are detected. See release [9.0.0](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-php/releases/tag/v9.0.0) of elastic-transport-php.

You can have a look at the [BREAKING_CHANGES](BREAKING_CHANGES.md) file for more
information.

## Mock the Elasticsearch client

If you need to mock the Elasticsearch client you just need to mock a
[PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) HTTP Client.

For instance, you can use the
[php-http/mock-client](https://github.com/php-http/mock-client) as follows:

```php
use Elastic\Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder;
use Elastic\Elasticsearch\Response\Elasticsearch;
use Http\Mock\Client;
use Nyholm\Psr7\Response;

$mock = new Client(); // This is the mock client

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
    ->setHttpClient($mock)
    ->build();

// This is a PSR-7 response
$response = new Response(
    200, 
    [Elasticsearch::HEADER_CHECK => Elasticsearch::PRODUCT_NAME],
    'This is the body!'
);
$mock->addResponse($response);

$result = $client->info(); // Just calling an Elasticsearch endpoint

echo $result->asString(); // This is the body!
```

We are using the `ClientBuilder::setHttpClient()` to set the mock client.
You can specify the response that you want to have using the
`addResponse($response)` function. As you can see the `$response` is a PSR-7
response object. In this example we used the `Nyholm\Psr7\Response` object from
the [nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) project. If you are using
[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) you can even mock the `ResponseInterface` as
follows:

```php
$response = $this->createMock('Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface');
```

**Notice**: we added a special header in the HTTP response. This is the product
check header, and it is required for guarantee that `elasticsearch-php` is
communicating with an Elasticsearch server 8.0+.

For more information you can read the
[Mock client](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients/mock-client.html)
section of PHP-HTTP documentation.
