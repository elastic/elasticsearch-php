Elasticsearch PHP client
========================

[![Build status](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/workflows/PHP%20test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/actions) [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/elasticsearch/elasticsearch) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/elasticsearch/elasticsearch)

This is the official PHP client for 
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/).

## Installation

Refer to the [Installation section](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_installation)
of the getting started documentation.

##Â Connecting

Refer to the [Connecting section](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_connecting)
of the getting started documentation.

## Usage

The `elasticsearch-php` client offers 400+ endpoints for interacting with 
Elasticsearch. A list of all these endpoints is available in the 
[official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html)
of Elasticsearch APIs.

Here we reported the basic operation that you can perform with the client: 
index, search and delete.

* [Creating an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_creating_an_index)
* [Indexing a document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_indexing_documents)
* [Getting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_getting_documents)
* [Searching documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_searching_documents)
* [Updating documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_updating_documents)
* [Deleting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_deleting_documents)
* [Deleting an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_deleting_an_index)

### Versioning

This client is versioned and released alongside Elasticsearch server.

To guarantee compatibility, use the most recent version of this library within 
the major version of the corresponding Enterprise Search implementation.

For example, for Elasticsearch `7.16`, use `7.16` of this library or above, but 
not `8.0`.

## Backward Incompatible Changes :boom:

The 8.0.0 version of `elasticsearch-php` contains a new implementation compared 
with 7.x. It supports [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) for HTTP 
messages and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) for HTTP client 
communications. 

We tried to reduce the BC breaks as much as possible with `7.x` but there are 
some (big) differences:

- we changed the namespace, now everything is under `Elastic\Elasticsearch`
- we used the 
  [elastic-transport-php](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-php) 
  library for HTTP communications;
- we changed the `Exception` model, using the namespace 
  `Elastic\Elasticsearch\Exception`. All the exceptions extends the 
  `ElasticsearchException` interface, as in 7.x
- we changed the response type of each endpoints using an 
  [Elasticsearch](src/Response/Elasticsearch.php) response class. This class 
  wraps a a [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) response allowing the 
  access of the body response as array or object. This means you can access the 
  API response as in 7.x, no BC break here! :angel:
- we changed the `ConnectionPool` in `NodePool`. The `connection` naming was 
  ambigous since the objects are nodes (hosts)

You can have a look at the [BREAKING_CHANGES](BREAKING_CHANGES.md) file for more 
information.

## Mock the Elasticsearch client

If you need to mock the Elasticsearch client you just need to mock a
[PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) HTTP Client.

For instance, you can use the 
[php-http/mock-client](https://github.com/php-http/mock-client) as follows:

```php
use Elastic\Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder;
use Elastic\Elasticsearch\Response\Elasticsearch;
use Http\Mock\Client;
use Nyholm\Psr7\Response;

$mock = new Client(); // This is the mock client

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
    ->setHttpClient($mock)
    ->build();

// This is a PSR-7 response
$response = new Response(
    200, 
    [Elasticsearch::HEADER_CHECK => Elasticsearch::PRODUCT_NAME],
    'This is the body!'
);
$mock->addResponse($response);

$result = $client->info(); // Just calling an Elasticsearch endpoint

echo $result->asString(); // This is the body!
```

We are using the `ClientBuilder::setHttpClient()` to set the mock client.
You can specify the response that you want to have using the 
`addResponse($response)` function. As you can see the `$response` is a PSR-7 
response object. In this example we used the `Nyholm\Psr7\Response` object from 
the [nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) project. If you are using 
[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) you can even mock the `ResponseInterface` as 
follows:

```php
$response = $this->createMock('Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface');
```

**Notice**: we added a special header in the HTTP response. This is the product 
check header, and it is required for guarantee that `elasticsearch-php` is 
communicating with an Elasticsearch server 8.0+.

For more information you can read the 
[Mock client](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients/mock-client.html) 
section of PHP-HTTP documentation.
