== Configuration

Almost every aspect of the client is configurable. Most users only need to 
configure a few parameters to suit their needs, but it is possible to completely 
replace much of the internals if required.

Custom configuration is accomplished before the client is instantiated, through 
the ClientBuilder helper object. You can find all the configuration options and 
check sample code that helps you replace the various components.
