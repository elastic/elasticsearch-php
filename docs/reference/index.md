# {{es}} PHP client overview [overview]

{{es}} PHP client is designed to be a low-level client, providing direct access to the REST API without adding extra layers or abstractions.
All methods closely match the REST API and the method structure of other language clients as well. For example, Ruby, Python, and so on. This makes it easier to get started with a client and seamlessly switch from one language to another with minimal effort.

The client allows you to make API calls and read the response in multiple formats: associative array, object, raw string, or [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) response.

For a step-by-step quickstart with the client, refer to the [Getting started guide](/reference/getting-started.md)  .


## PSR 7 standard [psr-7-standard]

The {{es}} PHP client uses the [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) 7 standard. This standard is a community effort that contains a set of interfaces defined by the PHP Framework Interop Group. For more information, refer to the [PSR 7 standard documentation](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).


## {{es}} and PHP client version compatibility [version-compatibility]

The {{es}} PHP client is compatible with PHP versions that are currently maintained and supported.

{{es}} language clients are forward compatible. This ensures that the client remains compatible with {{es}} instances running the same or newer minor versions, preventing any breaking changes. However, for all new features in the newer {{es}} versions, the client will support them only after a new client version is released. For example, the `8.12` {{es}} PHP client does not support new features in
{{es}} `8.13`. You must upgrade to the `8.13` version of the {{es}} PHP client to use them. 

{{es}} language clients are backward-compatible only with default distributions and there are no guarantees for customized or modified versions. The following table provides the compatibility information between {{es}} and {{es}} PHP client:

| Elasticsearch Version | Elasticsearch-PHP Branch | Supported |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| main                  | main                     |           |
| 9.x                   | 9.x                      | 9.x       |
| 8.x                   | 8.x                      | 8.x       |

## Changes and compatibility notes for {{es}} PHP client 9.x

The `elasticsearch-php` client version `9.x` follows the same architecture as `8.x`. It continues to support [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) for HTTP messages and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) for HTTP client communications.

Although we've worked to keep `9.x` backward compatible, the following important changes may impact your setup:
- Compatibility with {{es}} `9.x`: All changes and additions to {{es}} APIs `9.x` release are reflected in the `elasticsearch-php` client release. You must use `elasticsearch-php` client version `9.x` to access all new endpoints in {{es}} `9.x`. Using an older client version will break your code.
- Compatibility with {{es-serverless}}: 
  - The `elastic/elasticsearch-serverless` is deprecated, and all its functionality has been merged into the `elasticsearch-php` client. This doesn't have any impact on the default working of the client.
  - If you use any endpoint available in {{serverless-short}}, you'll see that the corresponding PHP function contains a `@group serverless` phpdoc attribute.
  - If you use any endpoint that is not available in {{serverless-short}}, you'll get a `410` HTTP error with the message: `This endpoint exists but is not available when running in serverless mode`.
  - If you use a URL managed by Elastic, for example `*.elastic.cloud`, the `9.x` client will recognize that it is communicating with a serverless instance.
  - If you are using a proxy, the `9.x` client will recognize that the host is serverless from the first response. Alternatively, you can explicitly specify that the host is serverless using the `Client::setServerless(true)` function. The argument to this function is set to `false` by default.
- New transport library with PSR-18 cURL client as default: We've removed the `Guzzle` dependency from the client. The built-in cURL-based HTTP client will be used by default if no other PSR-18 compatible clients are detected. See release [9.0.0](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-php/releases/tag/v9.0.0) of elastic-transport-php.
